        <p>My plan was to use no library, unless it is clear to me that
        -- I am wasting too much time reinventing the wheel
        -- This is beyond me.
        
        So, handcoded Vanilla JS first. Libraries only when needed.
        Every bit of 3rd party code that you use comes with its own baggage and one should always check if the weight of baggage is less than the gains from using it.
        
        It also helps that I am making a simple Find your meal app; with a list of JS in a page. Something that the new versions of JS (ES6) are well suited to handle.</p>
